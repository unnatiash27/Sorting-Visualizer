# Sorting-Visualizer

This project aims to create a dynamic graph visualization using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The graph represents data in a visual format to help users understand and analyze the information more easily.

#Introduction
The Sorting Visualizer project is a program that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work and how they rearrange elements in a list to achieve a sorted order. This README file will guide you through the project and explain how to set it up and use it effectively.

#Features
Visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Randomized data generation for sorting demonstration.
Real-time visualization of the sorting process with colored bars representing the elements.


#Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: The project's user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS.
JavaScript: The sorting algorithms and visualization logic are implemented in JavaScript.
